## What is Destination Imagination?

Destination Imagination (DI) was founded in 1999 as a volunteer-led,
educational non-profit organization that teaches
<a target=" " href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics">**STEM**</a>
skills and principles through team-based problem solving challenges - or
Team Challenges.

## The DI Team Challenge

The DI Team Challenge has three main components: (1) Instant Challenges,
(2) The Central Challenge, and (3) Team Choice Elements

### Instant Challenges

In an instant challenge teams are given a short period of time to create
a solution to a problem.

### The Central Challenge

Each year, DI releases seven challenges, each geared toward specific
learning objectives. These challenges are open-ended projects that teams
work on over an extended period of time, usually 2-4 months. Teams
compete by presenting their solutions at local tournaments between
February and April. If teams qualify at their regional and state/country
level tournaments, they are invited to showcase their solution at Global
Finals in May.

Your DI team manager will review each of these challenges with the team
so that they can choose which challenge they want to solve. The full
documentation for each challenge is not publicly available, but DI
publishes a preview of the challenges for families and team members to
review.

**BEFORE OUR FIRST MEETING PLEASE VISIT**
<a href="https://www.destinationimagination.org/challenge-program/2021-22-challenge-previews/" target="_blank"><strong>THIS SITE</strong></a>.
While there, watch the preview video with your child - it provides a
detailed synopsis of each challenge.

The following sections provide more information about each of the DI
challenge areas and will be updated regularly.

<b>Technical</b>
</summary>
<p>
The Technical Challenge requires teams to build equipment, such as
vehicles, in order to solve their challenge. They must also include a
performance, in a specific form or about a general topic supplied with
the challenge. In addition, the challenge requires teams to create
specific elements unique to the team that will count as Team Choice
Elements. The team will be evaluated on their creativity and
originality, the quality, workmanship and effort, and the integration of
the elements into the presentation. Normally, Team Choice Elements
account for 15% of a team’s score. The Team Choice Element can be
anything that the team chooses, as long as it is not a scoring element.

<b>Scientific</b>
</summary>
<p>
The Scientific Challenge requires teams to do research on a specific
aspect of science, and then create a performance based on it. Sometimes,
there is also a specific requirement to build a certain kind of prop or
costume. In addition, the challenge requires teams to create two
specific elements unique to the team that will count as Team Choice
Elements. The team will be evaluated on the creativity and originality,
the quality, workmanship and effort, and the integration of the element
into the presentation. Normally, Team Choice Elements account for 15% of
a team’s score. The Team Choice Element can be anything that the team
chooses, as long as it is not a scoring element. <br/> <!-- <center> -->

<b>Fine Arts</b>
</summary>
<p>
The Fine Arts Challenge requires teams to create and act out a
performance that demonstrates some theatrical technique. It may be to
use a certain method of presentation or to make a certain type of prop.
In addition, the challenge requires teams to create two specific
elements unique to the team that will count as Team Choice Elements. The
team will be evaluated on the creativity and originality, the quality,
workmanship and effort, and the integration of the element into the
presentation. Normally, Team Choice Elements account for 15% of a team’s
score. The Team Choice Element can be anything that the team chooses, as

<b>Improvisational</b>
</summary>
<p>
The Improvisational Challenge requires teams to think on their feet and
create a skit within a short window of time, and then present it. There
is usually a theme, of some sort, as well as a prop requirement that
requires teams to create or incorporate different props. The team will
also be evaluated for teamwork in this challenge. <br/>

<b>Engineering</b>
</summary>
<p>
The Engineering Challenge requires teams to create a structure, with
material and weight requirements, as well as an accompanying performance
that has to do with some aspect of the structure. The structures are
scored using a weight held ratio (WHR), where the weight held at the
tournament is divided over the weight of the structure, to create a fair
comparison of team structures. Some years, there have been additional
elements that the team had to incorporate into their structures, such as
holding golf balls. By performing these extra tasks, the team may
receive additional weight held credit. In addition, the challenge
requires teams to create two specific elements unique to the team that
will count as Team Choice Elements. The team will be evaluated on the
creativity and originality, the quality, workmanship and effort, and the
integration of the element into the presentation. Normally, Team Choice
Elements account for 15% of a team’s score. The Team Choice Element can
be anything that the team chooses, as long as it is not a scoring
element. <br/> <!-- <center> -->

<b>Service Learning</b>
</summary>
<p>
The Service Learning Challenge, also known as projectOUTREACH, requires
teams to do a service project that benefits their community, and then
create a performance to present at the tournament. The challenge always
has a theme that the team has to incorporate into their skit, or the way
they carry out their project. For some program seasons, the challenge
requires teams to create two specific elements unique to the team that
will count as Team Choice Elements. The team will be evaluated on the
creativity and originality, the quality, workmanship and effort, and the
integration of the element into the presentation. Normally, Team Choice
Elements account for 15% of a team’s score. The Team Choice Element can
be anything that the team chooses, as long as it is not a scoring
element. <br/> <!-- <center> -->

### Team Choice Elements

More to come on this.

## Interference

An important concept in DI is minimizing **interference** from the team
manager, friends, and the team members parents. Clearly, we all want to
help the team do well this season – and we can – but we need to be aware
of the types of help that cross the line and are consider as
interfering.

Destination Imagination Inc. published a document outlining what
constitutes interference. This document can be accessed by visiting
<a target=" " href="https://www.destinationimagination.org/blog/what-is-interference/">**this
site**</a>

### Example of helping vs. interfering

Suppose that part of the team’s challenge solution involves building a
birdhouse. Most would agree that building a birdhouse involves the
following tasks/skills (not an exhaustive list)

-   measuring
-   choosing materials
-   cutting/sawing
-   drilling holes
-   driving screws
-   hammering nails
-   glueing
-   painting

As outside helpers we **CAN** teach them how to do all of these things –
even introducing them to experts who can help explain how to do these
things. **However**, when it comes time for the team members to use the
skills that they learned to build the birdhouse that will part of their
solution – the team must do this by themselves (we’ll obviously
supervise to make sure they stay safe).

### Questions about interference

-   **What if the teams gets stuck while building their solution and
    asks me a question about what to do?**

    -   You should not simply give them the answer, instead you should
        talk to the team to help guide their thoughts on how best to
        proceed
    -   Examples of this would be asking probing/guiding questions that
        helps THEM come up with the way forward

-   **What if my child tells me how they’re stuck at some point in
    creating their solution and I have the PERFECT idea - should I
    suggest it to them?**

    -   No, you should not suggest specific solution ideas, but you can
        ask them questions that will help THEM arrive and the best
        answer themselves – *even if it’s not your perfect idea* 😭
    -   Moreover, if you do suggest a specific idea to the team not only
        is this considered interference, but the team is also disallowed
        from further pursuing this idea – because the original idea did
        not come from a member of the team

Early on it may be difficult to remember these rules. **Remember**, when
your child asks for help with their solution, be patient and resist the
urge to do what may seem like the most obvious thing to do.
